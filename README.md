## Infformation (information-formation)
1) category
2) drawing
3) mapped-location

## What
This project will be a ui experience that tries to be cool but info heavy.

## How
1) Category: start out with an item and list all of the related details you want captured.<br/>
sometimes taxonomy is used as a term to make a giant list around a topic.
2) Drawing: design logos/images that fit each defined item.
3) Put all of the drawings and topics together into an imaginary world, a room, a city, a state, etc.
4) Mapped Location: find a place in real life where your fictional world can live.
5) Make other mapped locations with other information.

## Regarding information:
information can be ordered 
1) in terms of time.
2) in terms of space.
3) in reality written in a notebook
4) in reality printed out and hung on a wall
5) as a sign in a bike shop telling a story.
6) in a habit.
8) information can be ordered and exist in the mind.

and all of these information points can intersect and influence one another.
